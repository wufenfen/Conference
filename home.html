    <p class="STYLE7">Recent years have witnessed dramatic and remarkable developments in the field of geometry analysis, especially complex/Kahler geometry, symplectic geometry, and Riemannian geometry. We believe that it is important to bring together an active group of researchers in these and adjacent fields, in an environment conducive to the exchange of ideas, for the purpose of stimulating further research in this broad and dynamic field</p>
