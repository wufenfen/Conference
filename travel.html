    <p><strong>Transportation : from Shanghai to Hefei</strong></p>
    <p>There are direct flights daily from Shanghai to Hefei. There will be shuttle buses taking guests from the airport to our hotel.</p>
    <p>One can also take high-speed rail. There are several dozens of trains each day from Shanghai to Hefei which takes about three hours. However, we do not recommend this mode of transportation as it is not possible to reserve a ticket online and it often takes a long time on waiting lines to purchase tickets at train stations. </p>
